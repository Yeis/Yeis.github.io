# Other Blogs

While going through the journey of being an indie game developer, you gotta try and learn to use your time as good as possible. And I have found that the best and 
easy way of keeping up with all the amazing things there is to learn is to truly listen and care about other game devs have to say. Hence I have gather some of my favorites game dev 
blogs and tutorials into the following page:

* [Game Dev Unboxed](https://gamedevunboxed.com/category/getting-started/)
* [Alan Zucconi Blog](http://www.alanzucconi.com/)
