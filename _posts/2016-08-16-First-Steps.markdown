After putting quite a thought about it. I finally decided to start my blogging journey, where I basically want to let people know about the things that I'm currently working on and share some thoughts and resources. my main objective of doing this, is to create a sense of order by having a personal journal that at the same time can help people to learn new things about programming, movies , music, games and life overall. But I will try to write more about programming.

For the people that do not know me my name is Jose Carlos Gallegos,(Yeis, for the friends) and I'm currently living in the lovely city of  Tijuana, Mexico, so if you're planning a vacation or you are just new guy on the city , send me an email and I will recommend you tons of stuff to do and places to visit. 

I have just finish my computer science degree here on a local university called CETYS, so I have been coding around 4 years from now, I do thing that I found myself a life passion that makes me exploit my skills and creativity in a way that I never thought it was possible.

After a brief description of my persona, I will start by talking about a current project that I will be working on the next few days. and it's going to be my first C++ game, as I wanted to start with an easy not too much time consuming project I will be making a Tetris clone like game, I will be using Visual Studio C++ ide and the project will be based on the SDL library and some of it extensions (SDL_Image , SDL_Ttf).

Most of my code will be based on the [Lazy-Foo-productions][Lazy-Foo-productions]  which has been the best tutorials that I have found on the web of SDL2.0 but I also encourage the learners to take a look at [aaroncox-net][aaroncox-net] which is also an incredible site to learn the basics of  C++ and game programming.

So without further ado, let's get our hands dirty.
